# Information-Visualization-Coursework
This is a repo for all of my projects for CSE557A:  Information Visualization, taken at Washington University in St. Louis during the spring semester of 2018.

Visualizations can be viewed here:  https://pmoh8.github.io/infoVis/

Assignment 2:  Reads in data from a CSV and displays the data as a bar graph or a line chart, with animated transitions.  Done in Processing.

Assignment 3:  Reads in data from a CSV and displays the data as parallel coordinates.  Users can click on axis names to flip the dimensions, hover over lines to highlight them and display more information in a tooltip, as well as select multiple lines by dragging.  Done in Processing.

Assignment 4:  An interactive cartogram showing election results by state from years 1940 to 2016.  Users can select a year to view from a timeline and mouse over states in order to see more information.  Done in D3.

Assignment 5:  A visualization of asthma trends in the United States from 2001-2009 by race, made to go with a news article that did not originally have an accompanying visualization.
